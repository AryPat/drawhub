## Proposal

### Description

> Realtime collaborative digital canvas application

- Multiple users can draw (with custom pen widths and colors) onto a canvas with realtime updates

- Users can invite others, using email, to join the canvas session, through a unique shareable link

- Users can "stitch" (copy/fork) other public canvases to add on top of it

- Users can save the canvas as an image and upload it to their personal Google Drive

- Users can view other users' public canvases

- Users can create private canvases, hidden to other users
  - Invite other users to join the canvas session, but only if the owner specifies a list of allowed users (using their email)
  - Users can 'stitch' public canvases into their own private ones

### Challenge Factor Concepts

- **OAuth 2.0 client**

  - Google OAuth2 Provider with Auth0
  - Use basic scopes for User information (name, email, profile picture)
  - Use any necessary scopes required for the Drive API

- **Real-time interactions**

  - Allows simultaneous drawing on a canvas between multiple users with realtime updates
  - Canvas updates powered via WebSockets
    - Drawing on the canvas
    - Clearing the Canvas
    - Uploading images onto the Canvas

- **Workers**
  - Use Redis as the database to store jobs in the queue
  - Emails are sent out when:
    - A canvas has been stitched
    - A collaborator has been invited to a private canvas

- **Integration with cloud technologies**
  - AWS S3 to store canvas images in blob storage
  - Google Drive API for uploading the canvas image to the user's personal drive

### Features by Beta Version
